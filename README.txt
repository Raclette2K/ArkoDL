This a README.
Please read it, even though I know no one will read it anyway.

# HOW TO USE? 
First, run the python file. If you don't know how to do that, google it.
Then, provide the arkotheque viewer url (yes, you have to click on the viewer it's not downloading that easily) and hit enter.
A new folder is created and your images will be inside.

# HOW LEGAL IS THAT?
IANAL, but I don't think you should use it without prior authorization. 
If you are a legal entity using arkotheque and are annoyed by that, just contact me and we will see what we can do together.

# DISCLAIMER
There is no warranty whatsoever on this program, use it at your own risk.
Also, I am not liable FOR ANYTHING happening when using this program. 
This is provided as is, if you have problems with it, learn python and fix it yourself.
